    "Mangement of municipal finances yields large amounts of data annually. Detection of transaction anomoalies proves difficult with time and resources available given the amount of data.\n",

    "Data analytics and machine learning can help process and evaluate the large amount of municipal financial transactions to find means of cost efficiency as well as any outliers that may be of fraudulent nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project includes the in-depth analysis and machine learning of a municipal's financial accounts. Benford's Law was applied to explore the data and a DBSCAN clusterning algorithm was used as an additional anomaly detector.\n",
