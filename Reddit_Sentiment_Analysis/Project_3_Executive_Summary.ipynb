There is complexity in identifying a model that can accurately predict which subreddit a discussion belongs to. However, through an iterative process and deep learning of the data, the resulting models were built with great accuracy."

Despite the shared verbage between the two classes, these models were 'tuned' and continuously analyzed in order to achieve high accuracy in predictions. Not only was word/phrase recurrence considered, but weighing of words/phrases in terms of frequency among discussions was investigated. Numerous metrics were applied to evaluate models, allowing further examination of the models imposed."
